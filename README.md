# Crowdfunding_ETL

This project is divided into the following subsections:

* Created the Category and Subcategory DataFrames
* Created the Campaign DataFrame
* Created the Contacts DataFrame
* Created the Crowdfunding Database

Category and Subcategory DataFrames
Extracted and transformed the crowdfunding.xlsx Excel data to create a category DataFrame that has the following columns:
	A `category_id` column that has entries going sequentially from "cat1" to "catn", where n is the number of unique categories
	A `category` column that contains only the category titles

Exported the category DataFrame as category.csv and saved it

Extracted and transformed the crowdfunding.xlsx Excel data to create a subcategory DataFrame that has the following columns:
	A `subcategory_id` column that has entries going sequentially from "subcat1" to "subcatn", where n is the number of unique subcategories
	A `subcategory` column that contains only the subcategory titles

Exported the subcategory DataFrame as subcategory.csv and saved it 

Campaign DataFrame
Extracted and transformed the crowdfunding.xlsx Excel data to create a campaign DataFrame has the following columns:
	The `cf_id` column
	The `contact_id` column
	The `company_name` column
	The `blurb` column, renamed to `description`
	The `goal` column, converted to the float data type
	The `pledged` column, converted to the float data type
	The `outcome` column
	The `backers_count` column
	The `country` column
	The `currency` column
	The `launched_at` column, renamed to `launch_date` and with the UTC times converted to the datetime format
	The `deadline` column, renamed to "end_date" and with the UTC times converted to the datetime format
	The `category_id` column, with unique identification numbers matching those in the `category_id` column of the category DataFrame
	The `subcategory_id` column, with the unique identification numbers matching those in the `subcategory_id` column of the subcategory DataFrame

Exported the campaign DataFrame as campaign.csv and saveed it 

Contacts DataFrame
Two options for extracting and transforming the data from the contacts.xlsx Excel data:

Option 1: Python dictionary methods.

Option 2: Regular expressions.

Option 1:
Imported the contacts.xlsx file into a DataFrame.
Iterated through the DataFrame, converting each row to a dictionary.
Iterated through each dictionary, doing the following:
Extracted the dictionary values from the keys by using a Python list comprehension.
Added the values for each row to a new list.
Created a new DataFrame that contains the extracted data.
Split each "name" column value into a first and last name, and place each in a new column.
Cleaned and exported the DataFrame as contacts.csv and save it to your GitHub repository.


Option 2:
Imported the contacts.xlsx file into a DataFrame.
Extracted the "contact_id", "name", and "email" columns by using regular expressions.
Created a new DataFrame with the extracted data.
Converted the "contact_id" column to the integer type.
Split each "name" column value into a first and a last name, and place each in a new column.
Cleaned and then exported the DataFrame as contacts.csv and save it to your GitHub repository.


Created the Crowdfunding Database
Inspected the four CSV files, and then sketched an ERD of the tables by using QuickDBD
Used the information from the ERD to create a table schema for each CSV file.
Saved the database schema as a Postgres file named crowdfunding_db_schema.sql, and saved it.
Created a new Postgres database, named crowdfunding_db.
Using the database schema, created the tables in the correct order to handle the foreign keys.
Verified the table creation by running a SELECT statement for each table.
Imported each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.
Verified that each table has the correct data by running a SELECT statement for each.
